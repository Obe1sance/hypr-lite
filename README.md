# hypr-lite
a basic modular hyprland configuration. 
I will not maintain these dotfiles. 
These dotfiles will require light modification for compatability. Primarily monitors.conf for screen compatability and others to suit.

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Place the contents of hypr into ~/.configs/hypr. 
Update /config/monitors.conf to properly reflect your display setup
Restart session / reboot

This should make it usable, the rest of the configuration modify to suit and exec ```hyprctl reload```
